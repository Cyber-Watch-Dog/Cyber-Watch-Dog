# 👋 Hi, I’m Yash Pawar

- 👀 I’m interested in ethical hacking, bug bounty hunting, cybersecurity tools, AI assistants like JARVIS, and building t-shirt brands for hackers & coders.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced penetration testing techniques, developing automated recon tools, and working with NS-3 for secure VANET protocol simulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools, CTF challenges, and creative projects that combine AI, cybersecurity, and automation.
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on GitHub or connect via my cybersecurity community (coming soon 👀).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once earned a bounty for discovering a subdomain takeover vulnerability and made it to the Hall of Fame 🏆
